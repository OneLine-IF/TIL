- AVL tree
	- AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree, height-balanced tree, and it takes O(logn) time to perform search, insert and delete opearations
	- the height of the tree is limited to O(logn) then time complexity is O(logn)
	- it stores an additional variable called the BalanceFactor
	- the balance factor of a node is calculated by subtracting the height of its right sub-tree from the height of its left sub-tree
	- Balance factor = Height(left sub-tree)-Height(right sub-tree)
	- every node has a balance factor of -1,0, or 1 is said to be height balanced
	- if the balance factor of a node is 1, left-sub tree of the tree is one level higher than that of the right sub-tree, left-heavy tree
	- if the balance factor of a node is 0, left-sub tree is equal to the right-sub tree
	- if the balance factor of a node is -1, left-sub tree of the tree is one level lower than that of the right sub-tree, right-heavy tree
	- Insertions and deletions from an AVL tree may disturb the balance factor of the nodes, thus, rebalancing of the tree may have to be done
	- The tree is rebalanced by performing rotation at the critical node
		- LL rotation
		- RR rotation
		- LR rotation
		- RL rotation

- Searching for a Node in an AVL tree
	- O(logn) time to complete

- Inserting a New Node in an AVL tree
	- the same way as it is done in a binary search tree
	- the new node is always inserted as the leaf node, but the step of insertion is usually followed by an additional step of rotation
	- rotation is done to restore the balance of the tree, but if the balance factor of every node is still -1,0,or 1, then rotation are not required
	- LL Rotation
		- a new node is inserted in the left sub-tree of the left sub-tree of the critical node A (node A is the critical node because it is the closest ancestor whose balance factor is not -1,0,1)
	- RR Rotation
		- a new node is inserted in the right sub-tree of the right sub-tree of the critical node A (node A is the critical node because it is the closest ancestor whose balance factor is not -1,0,1)
	- LR Rotation
		- a new node is inserted in the right sub-tree of the left sub-tree of the critical node A (node A is the critical node because it is the closest ancestor whose balance factor is not -1,0,1)
	- RL Rotation
		- a new node is inserted in the left sub-tree of the right sub-tree of the critical node A (node A is the critical node because it is the closest ancestor whose balance factor is not -1,0,1)

- Deleting a Node from an AVL tree
	- Deletion of a node in an AVL tree is similar to that of binary search tree
	- Deletion may disturb the AVLness of the tree, so to rebalance the AVL tree, we need to perform rotations
	- There are two classes of rotations that can be performed on an AVL tree after deleting a given node, These rotations are R rotation and L rotation
